# Bundle Calculator

## Context
Social media Influencers have been basing the price of their social media post on a single post basis. So If a brand required 10 posts (for example spread over a period) then they would be charged 10x the cost of a single post. One company has decided to allow social media influencers to sell posts in bundles and charge the brand on a per bundle basis. So if the Influencer sold image based posts in bundles of 5 and 10 and brand ordered 15 they would get a bundle of 10 and a bundle of 5.

The company currently allows the influencer to monitize the following submission formats:

Submission format | Format code | Bundles
----------------- | ----------- | -------
Image | IMG | 5 @ $450 10 @ $800
Audio | Flac | 3 @ $427.50 6 @ $810 9 @ $1147.50
Video | VID | 3 @ $570 5 @ $900 9 @ $1530

## Task
Given a brands order, you are required to determine the cost and bundle breakdown for each submission format. For simplicity, each order should contain the minimal number of bundles.
